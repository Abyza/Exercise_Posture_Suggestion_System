## Abstract
In today's increasingly sedentary society, where technological advancements often lead to decreased physical activity, maintaining proper exercise posture is crucial to prevent injuries and maximize the benefits of physical activity. In response to this challenge, we propose an exercise posture correction system that utilizes deep learning models and an error detection algorithm to analyze and correct exercise posture in real-time. The system consists of a device with a camera and software, which incorporates pose estimation and human activity recognition models to assess posture and classify exercises. The error detection algorithm identifies key angles for each exercise class and provides feedback to the user. Our software, developed using Unity, provides a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into exercise routines. Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, with high accuracy and precision scores achieved in both pose estimation and activity recognition. This system offers a promising solution to promote correct exercise posture, mitigate injury risks, and enhance the overall exercise experience.
