# Exercise_Form_Correction_Unity

This folder is a Unity project.

I used Unity editor version: 2022.3.10f1

The model for post estimation is missing because its file size is more than 100 MB so you have to install it from the link below and import it into the project.

Install the model from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bYw6NHUX8msriElndEnKqyFsb1Y6i7PF?usp=sharing
